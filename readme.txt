What is the aim?
This repository aims to
- share scripts with the scientific community
- facilitate the use of open access data availalbe on geo.be
- share correction factors applied during a method transition

Is it for me?
- This repository is developed for experienced .R users with wastewater-based epidemiological background

Why is it important?
- The use of open access data requires some understanding of the meta data
- Therefore, scripts availabe in this repository are essential to the correct use of Beglian data

Which steps are presented?
- The script "eu_wish-belgium_example.R" was developped to produc a graph at the national level
- The script "respi_virus-data_prep.R" was developped to prepare data at different levels in order to visualise them
- The file "data-correction_factor.csv" contains the correction factors to apply on different targets accordingly to the analytical method modification performed
